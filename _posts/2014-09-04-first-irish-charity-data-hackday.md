##### **Main Findings from first Irish Charity Data HackDay**

  1. No standardised way of tracking income and expenses
  2. Not all charities make income and expense data publicly available on their website
  3. When published, income and expense data is not published in an ‘open’ format

&nbsp;

##### **… and here is how it all went down on Saturday 26th July 2014 at Tcube:**

The day started with a welcome speech by our conveners and hosts Denis Parfenov and Flora Fleisher of Open Knowledge Ireland.  A [short presentation](http://openknowledge.ie/welcome-to-the-open-charity-data-day/) was given by Flora Fleischer.

Adrian O&#8217;Flynn, our Charities Subject Matter Specialist, and the person who inspired the event, introduced the topic of spending for charities in Ireland. He highlighted recent issues portrayed in the media and explained why it would be useful for the public to be able to compare charities based on their financial reports.  Here is [his presentation.](http://www.slideshare.net/AdrianOFlynn/solving-irish-charities-transparency-problem)

Adrian Corcoran, the event’s project manager, provided detailed instructions on how to work together for the day.  He followed this outline (<http://openknowledge.ie/chy-01-charity/>)

&nbsp;

###### **Three main datasets were used for the CharityHack:**

  1. An overview working document listing basic data about the charities: (<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sIH9NKBkpQMFMnt_0sYW9B8DSyv839EbbtLmibdml1s/pubhtml>).
  2. An excel spreadsheet ([CharityFinancialDataFinal.xlsx](http://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwvqlbZTmJr6TFQyYVVVYXB0eWc)), that includes detailed data for a number of charities, which were initially extracted from the annual reports by Adrian O&#8217;Flynn.
  3. A reference document which includes definitions of the codes used in the document above (e.g. expenditure codes)
  
    (<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sIH9NKBkpQMFMnt_0sYW9B8DSyv839EbbtLmibdml1s/edit#gid=861039018>)

&nbsp;

Participants were divided into three teams &#8220;red&#8221;, &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;blue&#8221;, following the team label of the charities in the overview document.

&nbsp;

Participants from each team picked a charity from the overview document.  Adrian Corcoran told us how to label the data, how to quality check the numbers within and how to verify the data with the annual reports. These data were then assembled into one shared document.  Data quality issues were reported and then corrected by Adrian Corcoran.

&nbsp;

Any issues were reported during this process and the more serious problems were shelved for later.

Once this work was completed, only data that passed data quality processes were included.

&nbsp;

###### **The charity data used for this CharityHack exercise are as follows:**

  1. Data were extracted from the annual financial reports of 24 of the largest charities in Ireland (€1Mil+).  NOTE This represents a small sample of the thousands of charities in Ireland.
  2. These are charities known through their public brand awareness for the fiscal year 2012 (see the [definition](http://nfpsynergy.net/about-nfpsynergy/jargon-buster#awareness)).
  3. ONLY charities where funding represents charitable funds collected voluntarily from the public were selected.  This excludes charities that primarily rely on large institutional funds (e.g., Irish Aid Grants, HSE Grants).
  4. Only charities that have been independently audited and who have published their financial statements on a publicly accessible websites were used.
  5. Only charities who followed the Statement by the Accounting Standards Board on the SORP Accounting and Reporting by Charities: [Statement of Recommended Practice](http://www.dochas.ie/pages/resources/documents/sorp05.pdf) were used (Section _B: Resources Expended_). Not all organizations in Ireland follow this standard. It is only because of this standard that it was possible to derive standardized financial data from the financial statements in the annual reports. The data here reflect resources spent on Governance, Fundraising and Charity.
  6. The list of charities was derived from the survey conducted by the [Irish Charity Engagement Monitor](http://nfpsynergy.net/nfpsynergy-monitors/irish-charity-engagement-monitor) (ICEM).
  7. This final dataset was quality checked by the participants at the 2014 Charity Hackday on July 26.
  8. The original dataset was created by Adrian O’Flynn.

&nbsp;

It is a small sample, but this illustrates the power of open data.

&nbsp;

The dataset that was generated on the HackDay, and which is being continuously developed, can be found on the  [Open Knowledge Ireland website.](http://openknowledge.ie/chy-10-datasets/)

Finally a **[first draft of a future website](http://app.uxpin.com/4f51c139aa0ded3ea77e46eada4a3f63193871aa/10171224#4)** was created, where charity data can be be displayed in an easy to understand fashion.

Thanks to Barry Alistair (TCube), Adrian O’Flynn (Charity Subject Matter Expert), Adrian Corcoran (Project Manager), and Denis Parfenov & Flora Fleischer for organising the Charity HackDay. And many thanks to all the participants who lent their time and skills! We could not have made as much progress in one day without you!
