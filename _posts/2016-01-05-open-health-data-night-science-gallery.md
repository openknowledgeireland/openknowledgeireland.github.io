Building on the health data meetups that took place [in March 2013](https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/meetup-4) & in [May 2013](https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/meetup-7), and Health Data Maker Party, [June 2015](https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/maker-party-hwl) we will be hearing about how open health data can save lives and help all of us to make better-informed decisions. We&#8217;ll also have a panel discussion on open health data to see how we can overcome some of the challenges.

Open Data Ireland was set up with the purpose of helping citizens access high value, machine readable datasets generated by the Irish Government. This community meetup is organised by Open Knowledge Ireland and WikiMedia Ireland. It will bring together people who are passionate about sharing, learning, using and progressing Open Data in Ireland.

**Date:** January 20th
  
**Time:** Doors open at 18:00. The event will begin at 18:30 and finish at 20:00
