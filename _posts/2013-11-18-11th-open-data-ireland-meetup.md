#### Open Data Portal for Ireland

Making open data usable, useful and reusable for the general public. This &#8216;portal&#8217; will enable access to public data, will make data about Ireland searchable and will be a platform for the Irish government, civil service and public entities to release data.

&nbsp;

#### Data Audit & Data Science Projects

The working group has already identified more than 160 open and not so open datasets. On Thursday we&#8217;ll continue work on data quality and gathering metadata for these data sets. This projects fits in with the above in that in order to populate the Irish Open Data Portal we need to identify more information about the data sets and then publish them on the portal.

#### Ireland&#8217;s first OGP Action Plan

Ireland will formally join the OGP next year and needs to draft it&#8217;s first OGP Action Plan. The government and relevant civil service departments have asked civil society to help identify actionable, measurable and realistic actions to be included. Civil society consultation over summer have generated a list ofÂ [62 proposals and 6 separate submissions](http://www.ogpireland.ie/2013/10/02/final-report-ogp-consultation/). Our meet-up on Thursday will be an opportunity to define if these are measurable, actionable and realistic and will be an opportunity to discuss the civil society processes around this.

#### Opendata.ie content strategy
