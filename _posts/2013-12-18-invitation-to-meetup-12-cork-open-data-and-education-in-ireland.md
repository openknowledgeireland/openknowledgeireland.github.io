This Open Data Ireland meeting will offer the opportunity to break into work groups and offer some time to collaborate with others. Bringing your laptop or tablet is encouraged as we hope that each group can gain practical experience building and encouraging online collaboration. The Open Knowledge Foundation has held two foundation <a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/booktype" target="_blank">Booksprint  <i class="icon-share-sign">&nbsp;</i></a> to start an Open Education Handbook to be distributed to educators interested in incorporating resources and influencing the way their education system sources learning materials. Think, an &#8216;Open Data&#8217; module in a box for 2nd level students; truly an important lesson in civics. This Booksprint is a great place to start contributing and networking with others who seek to accelerate technology in the classroom.

Anyone can join! If you&#8217;re new to Open Data Ireland, you&#8217;re welcome to just turn up and we&#8217;ll introduce you to everyone. With or without a laptop we&#8217;ll introduce you to the practical information to get started straight away. Together we build the community and resources needed to assist students, teachers, and national curricula. Think primary level maths books accessible by anyone, free of charge.

Open Data Ireland with the support of Open Knowledge Foundation seeks to build projects and regional hubs, sustained by volunteers, which will assist with facilitating community involvement with the Open Data movement worldwide; as well as coordinate and participate in the civil society aspect of <a href="http://www.ogpireland.ie" target="_blank">Open Government</a>. Through our regular meetups, hackathons and community-led projects, we work to create a sustainable infrastructure within Ireland to promote the values of openness, sector by sector.

A Booksprint is rapid and dramatic innovation to getting resources developed by experts in an open and crowd-sourced process. A group of Finnish mathematics researchers, teachers and students wrote an upper secondary mathematics textbook in a booksprint. The event started on Friday 28th September at 9:00 (GMT+3) and the book will be (hopefully) ready on Sunday evening. This book was written in Finnish. The result is published with open [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)-license. As far as we know, this is the first time a _course textbook _was written in three-day hackathon. The hackathon approach has been used earlier mainly for coding open source software and writing manuals for open source software. If you want to follow the progress, visit the <a href="https://github.com/avoimet-oppimateriaalit-ry/oppikirjamaraton-maa1" target="_blank">repository at Github </a>or the [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/oppikirjamaraton) (the conversation is mainly in Finnish, but you are welcome to comment and they will gladly answer in English).

&#8220;_We are encouraging rigorous Computer Science courses. Although individual technologies change day by day, they are underpinned by foundational concepts and principles that have endured for decades. Long after today, pupils leave school and enter the workplace, long after the technologies they used at school are obsolete, the principles learnt in Computer Science will still hold true._&#8221; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/michael-gove-speech-at-the-bett-show-2012" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link-sign">&nbsp;</i></a> <small>&#8211;<span style="color: #999999;">Michael Gove, gov.uk, Department for Education, 11 January 2012</span></small><span style="color: #999999;"> </span>
