As we are continuing our work to collaborate on drafting Ireland&#8217;s 1st OGP Action Plan in a Joint Working Group the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform D/PER has helped us to set up 2 meetings with members of civil society and officials from the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.

&nbsp;

The group of citizens and civil society organisation involved in collaborating on Ireland&#8217;s OGP Action Plan have asked for these meetings to discuss further the opportunities for more citizen participation, transparency and accountability in and of government. As these will be the overarching themes for the conversation. **But all interested citizens, organizations or business are welcome to attend. If interested you MUST indicate your attendance by adding your name to via the link above. **If you are interested but cannot attend in person you can also add your questions to the same document.

Please note this is a work very much in progress and the document is open for commentary.
