  This Open Letter was also published  as a <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/denis-parfenov/2013/10/18/open-letter-irish-minister-public-expenditure-and-reform-brendan">post on the Open Government Partnership Blog</a>. In May of this year Ireland has committed to the Open Government Partnership and now needs to deliver the country Action Plan that will allow it to formally join the OGP in April 2014. The Open Letter requesting a meeting with Minister Brendan Howlin T.D. was issued to give Irish citizens access and involvement in the generation of said action plan.

<p dir="ltr">
  Representatives of Irish Civil Society who have engaged in the Open Government Partnership (OGP)  process have written this open letter to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin T.D. We are seeking a meeting with him to clarify the future of the OGP process in Ireland. The letter is signed by 38 members of Irish civil society.
</p>

In the context of OGP, Civil Society needs productive meetings that can lead to useful outcomes and clarity of communication between the partners is vital for a constructive outcome.  We are seeking clear information as to the Government’s intentions for the OGP process, with the following in mind:

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    An important part of Ireland’s ambition to formally join the OGP is to open up the process for civil society participation.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Our goal is to open up policy making to the wider public, to raise awareness and allow civil society to influence and take part in generating a plan for Ireland’s participation in the OGP.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    We are offering the government our input, expertise and participation and we see this as an opportunity to co-determine the success of open government practices here in Ireland.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    We have identified ways in which the Irish government, public agencies and industries can become more open, benefiting everybody in Ireland and we see this meeting with Minister Howlin as a means of sharing, collaborating, and voicing ideas, issues and concerns, in the spirit of partnership which OGP promotes.
