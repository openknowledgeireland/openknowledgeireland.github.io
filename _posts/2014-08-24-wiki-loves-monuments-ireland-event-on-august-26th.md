This is Ireland’s inaugural year of participation in the annual competition which since its inception has resulted in nearly one million freely licensed photographs being submitted to](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) by tens of thousands of participants from over 50 countries. It is through local enthusiasts, researchers, and the cooperation of government, that Ireland’s cultural, historical, or scientific significance can be preserved and shared with the world. The Irish contest, focusing on Ireland’s national monuments, runs from August 23-September 30.

Open Knowledge Ireland is happy to participate in this effort.
