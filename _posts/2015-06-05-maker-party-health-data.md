[Join Open Knowledge Ireland and OpenStreetMap on Saturday, 13. June,](https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/maker-party-hwl) to prove that health data can be more useful if it&#8217;s accessible and available for reuse in open formats!

Date: **13 June 2015**
  
Time: **10am &#8211; 6pm**
  
Venue: **T-Cube Fleetstreet** (next to Palace Bar)
  
Registration: <https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/maker-party-hwl>

We will be working together on our [Open Hospital Waiting List Project](http://openknowledge.ie/projects/open-hospital-waiting-list/ "Open Hospital Waiting List") to:

  * increase transparency and accessibility of hospital data (i.e. waiting lists) through data liberation;
  * apply data to Open Street Map (OSM);
  * develop a strategy to make this information and the whole subject known to the wider public.

This April, over 190,000 people were waiting over six months for their first appointment with a hospital specialist in Ireland – of these over 11,000 were waiting more than 2 years. Waiting so long for that first specialist appointment results in poorer health outcomes, more expensive treatment and in some instance unnecessary and premature deaths.

The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) publishes its Out­Patient Waiting list and In­patient/Day Case Waiting list reports in PDF format which makes them impossible to access automatically thus limiting their usefulness. Over the past few months Open Knowledge Ireland has scraped the data from these NTPF lists and created a dataset of easily accessible information, available on <https://openknowledge.ie/projects/open-hospital-waiting-list/>. At our maker party we will drive this process even further with the goal of developing a movement for open health data in Ireland.

Open Knowledge Ireland (h​ttps://openknowledge.ie/)​ is the regional chapter of the global non­profit Open Knowledge network. Open Knowledge Ireland is at the forefront of Ireland’s Open Data community with the aim of developing a self­sustainable, enabling ecosystem for open data to empower citizens and organisations to make better informed, evidence ­based decisions. Our mission is to open up all essential public interest information and see it used to create insight that drives change.

&#8220;OpenStreetMap is project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. it was started it because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways. Almost 3,500 people have contributed nearly 12 million points of geodata to the current map of Ireland since the projects inception in 2004 and now members of the Irish OpenStreetMap community are delighted to be able to lend their GIS & mapping skills and provide free, open geodata to assist with facilitating greater transparency and understanding of the current situation with regards to hospital waiting lists. Taking part in initiatives such as this helps to foster the growth of a wider Open Data movement within Ireland and this is something that is fully supported by many within the Irish OpenStreetMap community&#8221; &#8211; Dave Corley, Community Organiser, OpenStreetMaps

Members of Open Knowledge and OpenStreetMaps communities are technology experts and experienced civic activists, with expertise in implementing the best global open data practices and tacit knowledge of unique challenges in Ireland. We are passionate about openness, and using advocacy, technology and training to unlock data to enable people to create, manage and share knowledge.
