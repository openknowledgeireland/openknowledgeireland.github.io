<p style="text-align: left;">
  What happened in the OKF Ireland world last week you ask? Where do we fit in the Irish open data, transparency, accountability and citizen participation debate? &#8211; You have come to the right place to find out.
</p>

We are trialing a new form of weekly updates where we aim to keep you posted and highlight what we found interesting, impressive, disappointing, exciting, and so on. All of these will usually be related to projects that we are currently working on. &#8211; Commenting encouraged.

##### Exciting &#8230;!

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://twitter.com/prfnv"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Denis</span></a></span> on our team is working tiredly to organise the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://ti.to/open-data-ireland/OGP-civil-society-day-Dublin-2014"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Civil Society Day</span></a></span> as a fringe event to the official European Regional OGP Conference that takes place 8-9th May. More info coming in the next weeks, but it looks to be a great networking evening with topical & focussed 15 min talks.

##### Interesting &#8230;

William Beaussang the Head of the Government Reform Unit and part of our weekly joint working group meetings with DPER has written a piece on Ireland&#8217;s OGP journey. Here is the link to the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/blog-editor/2014/03/24/ireland%E2%80%99s-ogp-journey"><span style="color: #0000ff;">blog post on the OGP</span></a></span> website where you can actually comment. They won&#8217;t let you comment on their own <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.per.gov.ie/irelands-ogp-journey/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">press release.</span></a></span>

##### Disappointing!

Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have told us they do not have time to research best practices around introducing programming and coding as compulsory in our schools. First of all &#8211; thanks for letting us know that there is no time to research citizen requirements! Second of all, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY &#8211; what the heck?! There&#8217;s a tech revolution going on and Ireland doesn&#8217;t want to take the chance to jump on the band wagon now? <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/10/by-next-year-coding-will-be-mandatory-in-british-schools-what-the-hell-america/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The UK are doing it from September this year</span></a>. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-25648769"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Estonia is teaching its 7- year olds for years!!</span></a></span>

##### OGP Action Plan

**[27/3/2014]** We had our 7th meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) to discuss <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2CotWwLulQ0a6zrJoniuqGq6ZGizgUvksDCKUmCPew/edit"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the latest draft of the OGP Action Plan</span></a> </span>which the civil society group had consolidated the Tuesday beforehand. Still very much work in progress but DPER has agreed to continue their work and flesh out the commitments under consideration of the comments made by citizens which you can see in the draft.<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LtNZfwbAD0j_HFaPAy5wxLwKdF-Xm9O1pSP2p5Dl6xo/edit"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> All DPER Action Points from the meeting of the joint working group.</span></a></span>
