On the 7th of May, the [Open Knowledge Ireland](http://openknowledge.ie/) in collaboration with the [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) and other civil society members and organisations are organising a Civil Society Day. This event provides an opportunity for any member of the public, representatives of the private sector and the government to come together and engage with each other.

&nbsp;

The Civil Society Day is an opportunity to network with thought leaders and active citizens in open government. Come along to learn from the experiences of delegates from other countries.

Taking place on the eve of the [OGP Europe Regional Meeting](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/node/3681) we&#8217;ll be discussing how to encourage governments to sign up to OGP and to co-create a process of open, continuous and fruitful collaboration between civil society and the government.

We are inviting you to co-organise this day with us. What would you like to get out of the day? Please add your suggestions [here](https://ogpirl.hackpad.com/OGP-Civil-Society-Meetup-7th-May-JUHgDwrls5N).
