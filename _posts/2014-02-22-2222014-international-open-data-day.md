##  [Sign-Up: 22/2/2014 &#8211; International Open Data Day](https://ti.to/open-data-ireland/international-open-data-day-in-ireland---feb-22nd)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What will it look like you ask? &#8211; Some pictures from an <a href="http://www.opendata.ie/irish-okfn-chapter-launched-at-ckan-hackathon-in-dublin/">Open Data Hackathon</a> we held last September. This Feb. 22nd <a href="https://twitter.com/OKFirl">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> are organizing a book sprint to create an open source and free to use textbook for schools that will help kids get coding and computing. A skill we all know they&#8217;ll need now and to build the future. Anyone can take part, we need lots of good souls who want to collaborate and contribute to this awesome project!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/codeforall_ire">@codeforall_ire</a> who have kindly organised the venue and will be making sure food & drinks encourage you to stay for the day! They will also continue work on their app projects if you want to jump on one of their teams.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We are also teaming up with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/opendatascienceireland/">Open Data Science Ireland</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/ODSIrl">@ODSIr</a>l) in order to hack on open data sets and create meaningful stories from data that can highlight the benefit of open data to the mainstream public, average Joe and public service. We are looking for both people who have problems and questions and people who can make sense of data to answer exactly those. <a href="https://ti.to/code-for-ireland/meetup-february-2014">Sign-up</a> or contact either <a href="https://twitter.com/OKFirl">OKFirl </a>or <a href="https://twitter.com/ODSIrl">@ODSIr</a>l
