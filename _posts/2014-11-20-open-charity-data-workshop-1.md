Dear NGO&#8217;s

We are inviting you to participate in the 1st Open Charity Workshop.

The idea behind this initiative is to help the Irish Charity sector to regain public trust. We want to achieve this by making **already publicly accessible information about your great work available for re-use in use-friendly in the 21st century non-proprietary machine-readable formats**. We want to provide your organisation with a possibility to show off stories about all thegood things donations achieve.

To do this, we need your help!

We want to present our project to you and we want you to help us with the stories behind it.

Therefore, Open Knowledge Ireland (<http://openknowledge.ie/>) would like to invite a representative of your charity to the

# [Open Charity Data Workshop #1](https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/open-charity-data-workshop-1)

**When:** [November 24th, 2014](https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/open-charity-data-workshop-1.ics), 14:00 &#8211; 17:00

**Where:**[Guinness Enterprise Centre, Taylor&#8217;s Lane, Dublin 8](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.3412%2C-6.28365+%28Guinness+Enterprise+Centre%2C+Guinness+Enterprise+Centre%2C+Taylor%27s+Lane%2C+Dublin+8%29)

**Register:**<https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/open-charity-data-workshop-1>

&nbsp;

**Idea**

Your organisation, like most other large NGOs have an independently audited report on

their website detailing activities for the year and financial statements. In most cases, the financial report is signed-off by the senior auditor in a high-profile accounting firm.

These are very credible and reassuring documents for any donor to read. The problem is that an individual would have to spend several hours reviewing separate charities’ annual reports before getting any sense ofwho they should be supporting.

Open Data can help make this easier for charities&#8217; donors.

### Additional Information

**What is open data?**

“A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.” (more [here](http://openknowledge.ie/open-data/))

### Background

One sunny day last July a group of volunteers [came together](http://openknowledge.ie/first-irish-charity-data-hackday/) to compile an open dataset for €640 million of 2012 charity data from 25 charities. We placed it in this visualization.[(_https://openspending.org/ie\_charity\_exp/views/charity-expenditure-2012-treebubble-chart#/%7E/total_)](https://openspending.org/ie_charity_exp/views/charity-expenditure-2012-treebubble-chart#/%7E/total)

### [Context](https://okfirl.hackpad.com/Open-Charity-HackDay-3tMoxP42U8M)

  1. &#8220;Charities in crisis as 400,000 people stop donating after recent scandals&#8221;[(http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/charities-crisis-400000-stop-donating-3385659)](http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/charities-crisis-400000-stop-donating-3385659)
  2. The government auditor has set the goal of establishing the charity regulator in 2014 [(http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/shatter-names-head-of-new-charity-authority-1.1709776)](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/shatter-names-head-of-new-charity-authority-1.1709776)

### Benefits

  * Reassure existing charitable donors that their money is being well spent.
  * Convince people who have stopped donating after the recent scandals to start giving again.
  * A prototype of the tool which makes it easy for anyone to assess how charities use donations deployed.

### Why you should go?

We want to collaborate with your organisation to create a tool**,** driven by already publicly available data, which will empower donors to get better insights into charities work.

  * You can add links to stories and video and photo content to your charities section of the dataset.

  * You will get a visualization for your own charity to display your data (like the above) on your website

[&#8220;Don&#8217;t let recent charity scandals stop you donating&#8221;](http://www.irishexaminer.com/analysis/dont-let-recent-charity-scandals-stop-you-donating-265943.html)&#8211; We agree and want to help Irish Charities re-gain trust by opening up charity data to everyone and by increasing charity transparency and accountability.
