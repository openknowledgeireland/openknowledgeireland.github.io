This 22nd of February, Open Knowledge Foundation together with Code for Ireland, Code for Dublin and the Open Data Science group,  are organizing a Book Sprint to create an open source and free to use textbook for schools that will help kids get coding and computing. We are in the information age. Today, with tools like the Internet, the process of sharing knowledge allows different groups to contribute, to have an exchange of ideas quickly and easily, to defining concepts and structure so that at the end there will be high quality content ready to being downloaded and read across the globe.

By definition, a Book Sprint brings together a group of people to produce a book in a short time. Collaborative writing is not easy; but it will open the way to new amazing works. We are inviting all people interesting in education to take part in our International Open Data Day, with the intention to be a space designed to facilitate the intellectual interchange of new ideas, as well as to be a space to write and think. Anyone can take part, we need lots of good souls who want to collaborate and contribute to this awesome project!
