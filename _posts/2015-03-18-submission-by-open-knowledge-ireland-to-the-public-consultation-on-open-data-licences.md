    Sir / Madam,
  </p>
  
  <p dir="ltr">
    Please find attached the submission by Open Knowledge Ireland to the public consultation on open data licences.
  </p>
  
  <p dir="ltr">
    Open Knowledge Ireland is very pleased at the Government’s decision to invite views on an open data policy for Ireland and the decision to review the Public Sector Information (PSI) licence.
  </p>
  
  <p dir="ltr">
    Open Knowledge Ireland (OK Ireland) is a regional chapter of the Open Knowledge Foundation. The OK Ireland is at the forefront of Ireland’s Open Data community with the aim of developing a self-sustainable, enabling ecosystem for open data to empower citizens and organisations to make better informed, evidence-based decisions.
  </p>
  
  <p dir="ltr">
    OK Ireland promotes open data culture through regular weekly, monthly and quarterly community engagements. Our events have been attended by thought leaders and notable civic activists.  Between October 2012 and January 2015, OK Ireland has successfully organised 15 community meetups, 5 hackathons, one Open Data training day and one OGP Civil Society day, with a total of over 1000 participants.We facilitate development of practical engagement with open data repositories. We organize training events, in which participants develop practical skills.
  </p>
  
  <p dir="ltr">
    OK Ireland is supported by a number of organizations which make world-class technology resources available for fostering innovative projects. For example, CKAN, the world’s leading open-source data portal platform, was developed by the non-profit<a href="http://okfn.org" target="_blank"> Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and is today overseen and managed by the<a href="http://ckan.org/about/association/" target="_blank"> CKAN Association</a>. CKAN is currently used by governments and organizations worldwide to power both official and community data portals, including the Irish Government Data Portal<a href="http://data.gov.ie/" target="_blank"> http://data.gov.ie/</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Members of OK Ireland are technology experts and experienced civic activists, with expertise in implementing the best global open data practices and tacit knowledge of unique challenges in Ireland. In September 2013, facilitated by <a href="http://openknowledge.ie/ckan-hackathon-hello-from-okf-ireland/" target="_blank">a community engagement day</a>, volunteers audited and catalogued datasets originally published by Irish government agencies. This exercise became a foundation for our input into the <a href="http://index.okfn.org/place/" target="_blank">Global Open Data Census</a>. At the same event, an Irish instance of <a href="http://ckan.org/" target="_blank">CKAN</a>, the worlds most advanced data repository, was deployed.
