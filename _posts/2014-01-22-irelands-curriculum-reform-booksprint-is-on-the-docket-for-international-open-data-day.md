  Fall 2014 the Irish secondary school system will introduce the availability of a short course in programming. This new course will be available to those schools who elect to offer it to their students. This is an excellent opportunity and a challenge. As of January 2014 there is only a draft curriculum. There are no lesson plans, professional development courses, or teacher resources.
</p>

  In order to be prepared to offer this new course, and introduce hundreds if not thousands of students to coding, schools need our help. Let&#8217;s crowdsource the best minds; and the best course materials; and volunteer to assist with implementing digital technologies in the classroom. Let’s make it an “open” process. Together we can build high-quality lessons with pedagogically sound underpinnings. We can aggregate the best on-line training resources into a world-class teaching guide. We can use the power of the Internet to connect school teachers to the vast experience of the community. Together this course can be the vanguard for open teacher resource. Introducing a level of collaboration to enhance and ease the way our teachers source material. Opening the process to allow for constant improvement. On 22 February, in conjunction with<a href="http://opendata.ie"> Open Data Ireland</a>,<a href="http://www.codeforireland.com/"> Code For Ireland</a>, and<a href="http://opendataday.org/"> International Open Data Day,</a> we will be gathering to build open educational resource, freely accessible, openly licensed resources to support this new course. This is your invitation, through collaboration with school teachers and industry experts can we build a truly useful resource. The community needs your help in ensuring that your local school is prepared to offer these new technologies. This is your chance to help.
