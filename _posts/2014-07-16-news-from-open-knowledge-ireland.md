Hallo everyone,

As you may know Open Knowledge (OK) is a non-profit organisation founded in 2004 and dedicated to promoting open data and open content in all their forms â€“ including government data, publicly funded research and public domain cultural content.

OK Ireland was officially introduced as OK chapter in May 2014; but since 2011 has been executing different kinds of projects under the topics School of Data, Open Government Data, Open Transport, Open Economics, Open Access and OpenSpending. OK Ireland is as well an active component of Irish Civil Society, we executed a civic campaign which resulted in a commitment of the Irish government to participate in the Open Government Partnership in 2013. We promote civil rights, and in particular, we advocate for a greater use of online tools as a means to increase citizen participation in public decision making. OK Ireland is a member of the Open Data Community, is working on opendata.ie to help citizens access to high value, machine readable datasets generated by the Irish Government and public sector authorities.

Actually, in parallel with our running project, we are making some changes and reform our organisation and we want to invite you to visit us, to have a overview in our activities, events, services, etc and not less important to give us some feedback to help us do much better our work and reach objectives.

Join us through our different channels of communication to follow along, participate, and stay informed:
