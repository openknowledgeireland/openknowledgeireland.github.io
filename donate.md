At Open Knowledge Ireland we build tools and nurture communities to develop, share, and use open knowledge â€” content and data that everyone can use, share and build on.

**We want to enable as many people as possible to have access to the information they need and the tools and skills to use it to improve the world.** We believe that the best way to have a lasting impact is to build stronger communities of people who will continue to push for change.

But doing this requires **time and money**. To organise and run events, train data wranglers and support community managers to rally coders, politicians, journalists and civil servants and work closely with key institutions to help them open up their data requires significant effort and resources. **Community support** is an area which is especially difficult to resource.

#### How else can I support Open Knowledge Ireland?

  * Much of what we do depends on those who **volunteer their time and effort** &#8212; by <a href="/projects/" target="_blank">building software to help people work with data</a>, <a href="https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland" target="_blank">organising and running local meetups to bring people together</a>, [writing handbooks](https://booksprint.hackpad.com/README-FIRST-Jr.-Cycle-Short-Course-5ptUVQwGyMO) , helping to develop and maintain our websites, and much more.

#### Is my support tax deductible?

  * Depending on where you live, you may be able to claim back tax on your donation to Open Knowledge, as it is a non-profit organisation.

Unfortunately we can not accept direct credit card donations anymore. We were attacked by a series of fraudulent transactions where for each one we have been charged 15 EUR service fees by our payment processor, leaving us with a negative over all result.
