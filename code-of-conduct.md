[OpenData Ireland / Open Knowledge Foundation Ireland](http://www.opendata.ie) is a community organization intended for building a community resource through increased networking and collaboration in the community.

We value the participation of each member of the OpenData Ireland / Open Knowledge Foundation Ireland community and want all to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees to every meeting are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees whether officially sponsored by OpenData Ireland / Open Knowledge Foundation Ireland or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organisers and volunteers at any OpenData Ireland / Open Knowledge Foundation Ireland event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout any event.

**The Short Version**

OpenData Ireland / Open Knowledge Foundation Ireland is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for OpenData Ireland / Open Knowledge Foundation Ireland.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event without a refund or remuneration of any kind, at the sole discretion of the event organisers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

**The Long Version**

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for OpenData Ireland / Open Knowledge Foundation Ireland.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

**Contact Information**

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff.

If the matter is especially urgent, please contact any of these individuals:

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
