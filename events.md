### [June 14th, 2016](https://ti.to/open-knowledge-ireland/knowledge-preservation.ics)

#### Venue: [TechMeetup.Space](http://techmeetup.space/)

#### Doors open at 18:00. The event will begin at 18:30 and finish at 20:00

Today knowledge is created at a rate that would have been inconceivable a generation ago. However, what can be done to make sure that knowledge created today is available to future generations? How do we determine what we might perceive as worth preserving if we have not the capacity to preserve all?

The theme for this Meetup is

## &#8216;Knowledge Preservation in the 21st century&#8217;.
