<span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px;">Introduction</span>

We wanted to make it easier for Citizens to understand the proposed commitments in Irelands OGP National Action Plan. Â The official word document is difficult to navigate online; therefore we decided to build a simple web application &#8211; which provides a graphical overview and enables easy follow through to the commitment details.

Additional columns &#8211; Civil Society Partners, Timescale and Notes &#8211; have been added and we welcome further opportunities to enhance the plan so that it contains SMART objectives which contribute to Open, Transparent and Accountable Government.
