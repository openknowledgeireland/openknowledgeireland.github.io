### Open Data Ireland

### Global Open Data Index 2014

  * [How advanced Ireland in open data?](http://index.okfn.org/place/ireland/)

### Open Access Ireland

### Open Charity Data (Charity Data Hack)

Recent scandals in the charity sector have eroded public trust. Consequently, donations have declined and many charities have been forced to significantly scale back on their services. OK Ireland, in collaboration with volunteers from the Charity sector have been working to reverse this trend by converting information from annual reports and other trusted sources into an Open Data format.

Following on from this, a prototype charity application has been developed which enables citizens to quickly browse key metrics from across a number of Irish Charities and as a result make an informed choice to donate and reward charities who are open and transparent. It is hoped that this positive feedback on loop based on the principles of openness and transparency will encourage real change in attitudes and encourage people to increase their donations to deserving causes.
